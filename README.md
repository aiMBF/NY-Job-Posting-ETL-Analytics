# dbt-bigquery
This project is based on Mazlum Tosun's tutorial named `ETL with DBT on Cloud Run Job` [Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8bGWV0Pfug] 

By adaptating this toturial, I build an ETL that gives insights about job postings available on the City of New Yorkâ€™s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml)

The tools used in this project are:
- NYC Open Data API: for the data
- Airbyte for data ingestion
- BigQuery: for data storage
- DBT: for Data Transformation
- Looker: for Data Vizualisation

The architecture of this project is descibed by the picture below:
